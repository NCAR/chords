<Records count="59"><Record><Term>Aggregate groundwater use</Term><Definition>An Aggregate Groundwater Withdrawal/Return site represents an aggregate of specific sites whe groundwater is withdrawn or returned which is defined by a geographic area or some other common characteristic. An aggregate groundwatergroundwater site type is used when it is not possible or practical to describe the specific sites as springs or as any type of well including 'multiple wells', or when water-use information is only available for the aggregate. Aggregate sites that span multiple counties should be coded with 000 as the county code, or an aggregate site can be created for each county.</Definition></Record><Record><Term>Aggregate surface-water-use</Term><Definition>An Aggregate Surface-Water Diversion/Return site represents an aggregate of specific sites where surface water is diverted or returned which is defined by a geographic area or some other common characteristic. An aggregate surface-water site type is used when it is not possible or practical to describe the specific sites as diversions, outfalls, or land application sites, or when water-use information is only available for the aggregate. Aggregate sites that span multiple counties should be coded with 000 as the county code, or an aggregate site can be created for each county.</Definition></Record><Record><Term>Aggregate water-use establishment</Term><Definition>An Aggregate Water-Use Establishment represents an aggregate class of water-using establishments or individuals that are associated with a specific geographic location and water-use category, such as all the industrial users located within a county or all self-supplied domestic users in a county. The aggregate class of water-using establishments is identified using the national water-use category code and optionally classified using the Standard Industrial Classification System Code (SIC code) or North American Classification System Code (NAICS code). An aggregate water-use establishment site type is used when specific information needed to create sites for the individual facilities or users is not available or when it is not desirable to store the site-specific information in the database. Data entry rules that apply to water-use establishments also apply to aggregate water-use establishments. Aggregate sites that span multiple counties should be coded with 000 as the county code, or an aggregate site can be created for each county.</Definition></Record><Record><Term>Animal waste lagoon</Term><Definition>A facility for storage and/or biological treatment of wastes from livestock operations. Animal-waste lagoons are earthen structures ranging from pits to large ponds, and contain manure which has been diluted with building washwater, rainfall, and surface runoff.

Additional information about specific kinds of wells should be recorded under the secondary site types or the Use of Site field. Underground waste-disposal wells should be classified as waste-injection wells.</Definition></Record><Record><Term>Wetland</Term><Definition>Land where saturation with water is the dominant factor determining the nature of soil development and the types of plant and animal communities living in the soil and on its surface (Cowardin, December 1979). Wetlands are found from the tundra to the tropics and on every continent except Antarctica. Wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands may be forested or unforested, and naturally or artificially created.</Definition></Record></Records>
