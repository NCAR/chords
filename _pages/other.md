Recommended Chords Resources are
- At least 2 CPU’s 
- Data Rates 10 seconds

Data are like music notes. If you try to play every single note at the same time you’ll run into problems.
Being that you couldn’t possibly play every note (unless you have extra hands, then kudos to you and play on).
you would struggle to play the instrument at all. The same idea applies to your data, if you try to download all your individual data points at the same exact time your system will likely freeze up.
However, if you stagger your data to one after the other then your download will proceed smoothly. Future updates for CHORDS will include bulk download. (putting all the music notes onto a sheet of paper and then sending them) which will allow you more flexibility with the size and amount of data that you download. However, for now please stagger. If data is staggered correctly then you could even go down to data rates of 5 seconds. If you truly wish to go lower it is recommended not to use a vm but hardware to speed up your data rate.
