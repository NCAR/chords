If you are working in academia then you are eligible to use a jetstream server.
You will need to submit a request for an allocation on the system.
If you are NSF funded you can create a jetstream instance for free and use the larger sizes without worry. Allocations are available to faculty members and researchers, including postdoctoral researchers, at a U.S.-based institution. Eligible institutions include federal research labs or commercial organizations; however, special rules may apply if your institution is not a university or a two- or four-year college. Investigators with support from any funding source, not just NSF, are encouraged to apply. You can still set up a Trial Access account but you be able to use an account with the same resources as the amazon t1 server. 
For more information please visit [XSEDE](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup#eligibility) to check their eligibility requirements.  

The trial resources include  

- 1000 Service Units (per cloud provider)
- 2 m1.tiny (1-core) OR 1 m1.small (2-core) Virtual Machine (VM) instance per cloud at a time
- 1 VM backup snapshot per instance,
- 1 small 10 GB disk external storage volume.
