  # A structured object is returned that is suitable for using as the
  # series atribute in a highchart chart. It will be an array of hashes.
  # Each hash contains attributes for one trace, including the data for
  # that trace.
  #
  # The returned object can be turned into json, using .to_json.
  # This can then be translated to javascript using the javascript
  # function JSON.parse().
  #
  # E.g., if you called make_highchart_series as:
  #     @series_by_minute = highcharts_series(:minute, 4.hour)
  # you can import this into the javascript with:
  # series = JSON.parse('<%= @series_by_minute.to_json.html_safe %>')
