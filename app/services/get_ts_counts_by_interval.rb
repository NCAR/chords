class GetTsCountsByInterval
  # Return the non-zero counts of a time series data field, binned by a 
  # time resolution and segregated by instrument.
  #
  # time_series_db - the database
  # end_time       - the end time of the time interval
  # field          - the series data field to count
  # span_s         - the length of time to span
  # resolution     - the interval for time grouping, e.g "1m", "4h", "1d", etc.
  # inst_ids       - the collection of all instrument ids (even ones without data)
  #
  # Return the times/counts in the following hash/array structure.
  # {
  #   1=>[
  #        [1478476800000, 7634],

  # Notes:
  #  Times are returned in ms resolution.
  #  If there is no counts for an instrument, there will be an empty array.
  #  Only non-zero counts will be returned.
