CHORDS has adopted the [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/) time-series database,
from [influxdata](https://influxdata.com).

InfluxDB is a high performance database, designed specifically for time-series
appllications. Changing from the original MySQL database for data storage
allows CHORDS to manage, navigate, and deliver much larger datasets. Currently active
CHORDS deployments have reached the size of 50M measurements.

The InfluxDB database is implmented as an independent Docker service, which then is
accessed by other containers in the CHORDS application suite. The Rails and Grafana 
applications currently access the database; others can be added in the future, as 
new requirements are discovered.
