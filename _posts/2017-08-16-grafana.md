Powerful dashboard capabilities have been added to CHORDS. Users can create 
sophisticated realtime displays, with exceptional time navigation
features, right in their browser. 

These are provided via the terrific opensource [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) 
system. Grafana is implemented in CHORDS as a separate web server running
as a Docker container. Highly responsive graphics are possible because Grafana has
direct access to the CHORDS InfluxDB database.

The Grafana graphics are triggered by hitting the Visualiztion link
on the CHORDS website. Here are examples of custom displays
that a user can configure online:

![Grafana1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/grafana_1.png){:class="img-responsive"}
